tumblr-template-sass
====================

Tumblr template using SASS, Compass, Grunt, and Bower.

## INSTALLATION
Run these commands in a terminal
 - git clone https://github.com/shadesoflight/tumblr-template-sass
 - cd tumblr-template-sass
 - npm install
 - bower install
 - gulp

Gulp will end with a watch task, recompiling the templates and sass files when you edit them.
Note that all assets are compiled into build/theme.tumblr, build/theme.js, and build/theme.css in the root of the repository.

 - copy the contents of build/theme.tumblr/main.tumblr to the theme's HTML editor
 - upload and insert both theme.js and theme.css as static assets
